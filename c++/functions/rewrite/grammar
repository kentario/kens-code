## Using stuff from here: https://craftinginterpreters.com/parsing-expressions.html
## Going from lowest to highest precedence

expression -> term;
term -> factor ( ('+' | '-') factor)*;
factor -> power ( ('*' | '/') power)*;
power -> unary ('^' unary)?
unary -> ("sqrt" | '-') unary | primary;
primary -> NUMBER | VARIABLE | '(' expression ')';
